Two kinds of analysis can be performed: 

###Identify preceding events for defined histopathology
Here, users can explore the time concordance of different types of events (TFs, Pathways, Histopathology) preceding adverse histopathology. While in our analysis adverse histopathology was defined as a set of different histopathological findings, users can also supply their own definition, e.g. focussing only on fibrosis or biliary hyperplasia, and study events of interest based on this.

<i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-h"></i> ###Look up interaction between 2 events of interest
Once 2 events of interest are identified, e.g. based on time concordance analysis from the 1st tab but also based on expert knowledge, the relation between both events can be analysed further in this 2nd tab.This will provide an overview of time series where any of the given events is observed, providing further insight into when each event was activated in each time-series.
 
The app was developed by Anika Liu (<a href="mailto:al862@cam.ac.uk" target="_blank"><i class="far fa-paper-plane"></i></a>) under the supervision of Dr. Andreas Bender, Dr. Namshik Han and Dr. Jordi Munoz-Muriedas.
