# DILICascades App
In this app, you can prioritize transcription factors (TFs) and pathways based on time concordance from TG-GATEs in vivo liver data for any histopathological finding or combination thereof. Also it is possible to explore in further detail in which compound-dose combinations time concordance is observed and at which times the events are activated.
